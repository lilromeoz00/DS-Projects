### This is a collection of my machine learning and data science projects
### Ill eventually turn this into a github page & streamlit all this https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/getting_started.html
### Email me at JordanMooreNav@gmail.com for questions

ideas : Cancer detector CNN, Neural Cryptography, Colorize black and white photos, GANs & VAEs for Art, Path Finding, Recommender systems, RL & Games (Genetic Algo, Deep-Q, etc), Life Expectancy Regression, Auto Blur faces in imgs and video (CNNs + Gaussian), Figure out some neat unsupervised learning projects, Find out how to get voice synthesis working, Important: Get pipelines for image processing & data cleaning, Oo oo Tensorboard!! Pipeline using ML to filter non human images from facial datasets (very useful for comps like affectiva who take in large amts of img data) | 

#### Predict Illegal Fishing World Wide | Find Exoplanets with CNNs | Multimodel Gender and Age classifier (Voice & Image) | Tensorboard | Trust
