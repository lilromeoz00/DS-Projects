### I still feel like a script kiddie when it comes to neural networks. I understand every component, but I use libraries to make my life easier. I'll make a multi layer (deep?) neural network with all the fixings attached in pure python (numpy too of course). I'm sure this will be a great learning tool to reinforce foundational knowledge of my favorite ML topic. 
### I made a simple input output perceptron from scratch. I had it learn both AND & OR Logic gates with very high accuracy! It wasn't as complicated to understand as I thought it would be. I'm sure this simple model can be built to have larger input sizes for varied outputs.
