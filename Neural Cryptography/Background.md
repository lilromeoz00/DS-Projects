### My Dad is a cyber operations officer for the US Air Force which means I have been surrounded by cyber security based tech for a long time. Though hacking is cool, I always wondered how data encrpytion worked and what are other ways someone could make their own encryption to be basically uncrackable. I've done my fair share of hackathons with not many good results, but I always thought their capture the flag problems relating to steganography were awesome. Hiding messages inside anything they wanted sounded liek fun. I could take an image, video, game, anything I wanted and throw a secret spy message into it. I'll be trying to do that in this project using pictures and neural networks.
