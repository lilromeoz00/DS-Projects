### Were getting to the fun stuff now. Lets build what I actually use for basic models and then try to add things on top of it (dropout & others maybe?)
### I tried this out on the mnist dataset and got an accuracy of 98.04% That's pretty cool considerind top CNNs are within 1.5% points. I'll try to add dropout in future iterations.
