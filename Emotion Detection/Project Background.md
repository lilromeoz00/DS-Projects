### This project was made after my Gender Classification one. I was able to use some of Affectiva's data to train my model, which was very useful. In order to increase generality, I strectched and shifted evry image to get alot more data. I then used a CNN with the typical setup but doubled the filter amount with each new convolution. I used a neat training add-on which stopped the model's training session early if the validation loss did not decrease after 5 epochs, which would then restore itself to the best version. I'll be using that in future projects. Suprisingly though, I only trained the model for 75 seconds and got an accuracy of 60%.
### For my testing, I used some of my face, my dad, and a random crying kid from online. I tried to fool it on my last image by having a suprised open mouth but angry brows. It said I was angry with I can only assume to be because it places alot of weight on furrowed brows. Pretty cool!
