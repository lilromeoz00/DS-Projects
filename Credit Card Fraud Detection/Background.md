### I made my own buisness a bit back selling candy boxes online. I had a fair amount of sales, which generated me around $2,500 before I quit after 2 months. I had a good amount of fruadulent purchases which made me wonder how certain systems find these fraudsters. So I wanted to build one myself!
### This model did so much better than I thought it would've. I believe this is due to the models non-linear nature and the amount of data there is. Take a guess of what Test Accuracy I got before you hear it. I got 99.70%! Wooooo!! 
### I found something pretty weird though, no matter my epoch number, my best accuracy comes from Epoch 1. I wonder why..
### ~~Further digging suggests that I have no clue why it gave me 99% accuracy. I copied the entire model and redid it under a new name and it started at 49% accuracy.~~
### Even more digging I found out the second model was not training well because I din't "refresh" my callback and optimization functions. With this fix, I was reaching val acc of 99.8 again. I'll do some more experimenting to see how good I can get it. 
### Wow FINAL fix before I leave this project!!! Found some Major developments which lead me to get accuracy upwards of 99.99%! The findings led me to ditch my NN and try stuff like RandomForest & XGBoost. With cross validation XGBoost gave me an overall test set accuracy of 99.995% Amazing!
