### I made my own buisness a bit back selling candy boxes online. I had a fair amount of sales, which generated me around $2,500 before I quit after 2 months. I had a good amount of fruadulent purchases which made me wonder how certain systems find these fraudsters. So I wanted to build one myself!
### This model did so much better than I thought it would've. I believe this is due to the models non-linear nature and the amount of data there is. Take a guess of what Test Accuracy I got before you hear it. I got 99.70%! Wooooo!! I changed the model a little bit and tried to get a better model. 
### I found something pretty weird though, no matter my epoch number, my best accuracy comes from Epoch 1. I wonder why..
### __Further digging suggests that I have no clue why it gave me 99% accuracy. I copied the entire model and redid it under a new name and it started at 49% accuracy.__
