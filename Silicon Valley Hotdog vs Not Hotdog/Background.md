### Silicon Valley is a super funny show and one of my favorite episodes is when they were creating a "Seefood" app which would determine what kind of food an image is looking at. Though they didn't get it right, their failure was very funny. It got the hotdog right, and then when it went to another food it was just, Not Hotdog. Best scene ever.
### I've always wanted to do it even if it was a more simple project, it's still fun to see a funny idea come to life!
