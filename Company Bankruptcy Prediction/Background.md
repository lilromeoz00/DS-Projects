### This was a project I wasn't going to include in this repo because I didn't know if it added anything of actual value. May or may not delete later. (New folder for projects I don't want in the front page but still wanna show??)
### Even BIGGER thing I found though. I finally got KFold to work and I have a full understanding of it. This'll def be in it's own folder.
